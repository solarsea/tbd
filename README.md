## tbd
### a #tag-based dependency tool for low ceremony task tracking

### [Go here for the latest version](https://0dev.org/cgi-bin/repositories/the-shed) - as good as github is, I'm not dealing with that crap of a version control grotesque unless I'm getting paid for :)

#### [presentation](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/solarsea/tbd/tbd.slide#1)

#### In order to use:

* Keep your tasks in a text file named 'tbdata', one task per line
* Tag your tasks with #some #tags to indicate dependencies

#### Invoke tbd

* without any arguments to list all non-blocked tasks
* with tag names to list all partially matching tasks

Live, learn and take it easy :)
