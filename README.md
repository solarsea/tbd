tbd, a #tag-based dependencies filter useful for low ceremony task management

* Keep your tasks in a text file named 'tbdata', one task per line
* Tag your tasks with #some #tags to indicate dependencies

* Invoke tbd without any arguments to list all non-blocked tasks
* Invoke tbd with #tagged #arguments to list all matching tasks

Live, learn and take it easy :)
